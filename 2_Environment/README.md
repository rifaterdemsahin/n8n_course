# 2_Environment - Environment Setup & Configuration

This folder contains all materials related to setting up and configuring n8n environments for course participants. Whether you choose n8n Cloud or self-hosting, this section provides comprehensive setup guides.

## Overview

Before diving into n8n automation, you need a properly configured environment. This folder covers all aspects of environment setup, from initial installation to production-ready configuration.

## Setup Options

### Option 1: n8n Cloud (Recommended for Beginners)
- **Pros**: Easy setup, no server management, automatic updates
- **Cons**: Limited customization, subscription cost
- **Best For**: Learning, small projects, quick prototyping

### Option 2: Self-Hosted (Advanced Users)
- **Pros**: Full control, customization, cost-effective at scale
- **Cons**: Requires server management, manual updates
- **Best For**: Production environments, enterprise use, custom requirements
