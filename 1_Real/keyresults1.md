# KR1: Foundation Mastery (Sections 1-2)

**Target:** 100% of students complete fundamental concepts with hands-on practice

## Course Sections Covered:
- **Section 1:** Introduction to n8n & Workflow Automation
- **Section 2:** Building Your First Workflow

## Learning Objectives:

### ✅ Environment Setup & Interface Mastery
- Set up n8n environment (Cloud or self-hosted option)
- Navigate and understand the n8n interface
- Explore the Workflow Canvas and Nodes Panel
- Understand Credentials and Executions Log
- Save and activate first (empty) workflow

### ✅ Core Concepts Mastery  
- Understand n8n as a "fair-code" automation tool
- Differentiate n8n from Zapier and other automation platforms
- Learn about nodes (Triggers and regular nodes)
- Understand the flow of data between nodes
- Master node connections and workflow structure

### ✅ First Workflow Creation
- Build first workflow with Manual trigger
- Execute workflow and check output
- Complete data transformation project using Set node
- Work with simple expressions
- Pass data from one node to another

### ✅ Data Understanding
- Navigate JSON data structure
- Use Table and JSON views in output panel
- Work with variables (global vs execution)
- Debug workflows effectively
