Of course. Based on the detailed curriculum you've provided, including the lectures with existing video lengths, I can create a solid estimate for the total course duration.

My estimation methodology is as follows:
* For lectures with existing `.mp4` files, I will use the exact duration provided.
* For other lectures, I will estimate the length based on the complexity of the topic, the number of concepts being introduced, and whether it's a theoretical lecture or a practical, hands-on project.
* I'll provide a breakdown by section and a final total, then offer analysis regarding the sub-2-hour goal for a free course.

### Total Estimated Course Length

* **Low-End Estimate:** 18 + 26 + 27 + 20 + 26 + 7 = **124 minutes** (2 hours, 4 minutes)
* **High-End Estimate:** 25 + 34 + 37 + 29 + 37 + 11 = **173 minutes** (2 hours, 53 minutes)

My median and most likely estimate, blending the ranges, would be around **140-150 minutes**.

### Analysis & Recommendation

Your current curriculum outline is estimated to be between **2 hours 4 minutes** and **2 hours 53 minutes**. This puts it just over the **2-hour (120-minute) limit** for a free course on most platforms.

**Conclusion:** You are very close to your target, but you will need to be disciplined during recording and editing to bring the total time down.

**Recommendations to meet the < 2-hour goal:**

1.  **Condense the Projects:** The practical projects (Lectures 14, 21, 22) are your longest videos. Try to script them tightly. Have all your accounts, credentials, and sample data ready beforehand to avoid any on-screen delays.
2.  **Combine Short Lectures:** Consider combining "The 'IF' Node" and "The 'Switch' Node" into a single lecture called "Conditional Logic in n8n". Similarly, "Reading Data" and "Writing Data" to Google Sheets could potentially be one slightly longer, comprehensive lecture.
3.  **Be Ruthless in Editing:** Your existing short videos (like "Rate Limits" at 40 seconds) are perfect examples of being concise. Apply that same brevity to your longer lectures. Edit out any pauses, "ums," "ahs," or moments where you are waiting for something to load.
4.  **Keep Intros/Outros Short:** Ensure the welcome and wrap-up lectures are very direct and stay under 3 minutes each.

With some careful planning and editing, you can definitely bring this excellent curriculum under the 120-minute mark. Good luck!
