Of course. Here are several prompts designed to generate images for n8n's core concepts, focusing on a clean, modern, and high-tech aesthetic.

For best results, use these with image generation models like Midjourney or DALL-E 3.

### ## 1. The Workflow Canvas

This prompt visualizes the entire automation environment where different services are connected.

**Prompt:**
> A futuristic digital canvas representing a workflow automation. Luminous, interconnected nodes float in a 3D space, linked by glowing data streams. The scene is a mix between a neural network and a clean architectural blueprint. The overall aesthetic is minimalist and holographic, on a dark background with a color palette of vibrant purple, blue, and green.
>
> **Keywords:** high-tech, data flow, network, wide-angle, digital constellation, UI/UX design.

### ## 2. The Node

This prompt focuses on a single building block of a workflow, representing one specific application or function.

**Prompt:**
> A single, sleek digital module representing an automation node. The cube-shaped block has a glowing, minimalist icon (like an email or a database symbol) on its face. It emits a soft, internal light, suggesting it's active. The background is dark and uncluttered, creating a focused, iconic shot.
>
> **Keywords:** macro shot, isolated, module, building block, glowing icon, matte finish.

### ## 3. Connections (The "Noodle")

This prompt illustrates the flow of data between two nodes in a workflow.

**Prompt:**
> A close-up view of two abstract digital nodes connected by a vibrant stream of light. This "noodle" is a conduit of glowing data particles moving from left to right, clearly showing the direction of information flow. The aesthetic is clean and high-tech with a shallow depth of field, focusing on the energy of the connection.
>
> **Keywords:** data stream, energy flow, connection, conduit, particle effects, vibrant.

### ## 4. The Trigger Node

This prompt captures the moment a workflow is initiated, starting the automation.

**Prompt:**
> A dynamic image of a trigger node. A single digital block on the left emits a powerful, circular shockwave of light, initiating a chain reaction. The wave of energy travels towards other, dimmer nodes on the right. The concept is about initiation, a spark, or a starting gun for a process.
>
> **Keywords:** initiation, spark, high-energy, shockwave, starting point, cause and effect.

### ## 5. Workflow Execution

This prompt visualizes a workflow as it's actively running and processing data.

**Prompt:**
> An active n8n workflow in the middle of an execution. A sequence of nodes is lit up in bright green, with data visibly flowing along the connections between them. Previous nodes in the chain are dimming, and upcoming nodes are still dark, showing a clear, step-by-step progression. The scene is dynamic and conveys motion and processing.
>
> **Keywords:** in-progress, sequence, processing, real-time, dynamic lighting, automation in action.

### ## 6. Credentials

This prompt provides a visual metaphor for the secure storage of API keys and login information.

**Prompt:**
> A symbolic representation of secure API credentials. A glowing, holographic key hovers in front of a sleek, modern digital shield. The image conveys security, access, and trust in a high-tech environment. The style is minimalist with a dark background to make the glowing elements pop.
>
> **Keywords:** security, encryption, access key, digital vault, trust, minimalist icon.
