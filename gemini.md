# Gemini Coder - n8n Course Assistant

This file is generated by Gemini, your AI assistant for the n8n course project. It provides an overview of the project structure and explains how I can assist you in your learning journey.

## Project Overview

This project is an n8n course designed to teach automation concepts through hands-on examples, structured learning materials, and clear progress tracking using OKR methodology. As your AI assistant, I can help you navigate this project, understand concepts, and even help you with the code.

## Readme Structure
- Detailed explanation of n8n json in the folder
- Marp (Markdown presentation ) explains the readme
- In marp use emojis
- in marp use orange #f89d21 and blue #0277b5 colors
- at the last slide give external reading reasources at the end
- keep right bottom empty > i would have a green screened actor in the post prod

## Directory Structure

Here is a snapshot of the project structure. I can provide more details on any file or folder.

## How I Can Help

I can assist you with various tasks in this project. For example, you can ask me to:

*   **Explain a concept**: "Explain what the Set node does in the 'Simple Data Transformation' project."
*   **Summarize a file**: "Summarize the `keyresults1.md` file."
*   **Find information**: "Where can I find information about handling rate limits?"
*   **Modify code**: "Add a new step to the `daily-weather-report-workflow.json` to send an email."
*   **Create new files**: "Create a new project for sending SMS notifications with Twilio."
*   **Answer questions**: "What is the difference between global and execution variables?"

## Getting Started with Gemini

To get started, simply ask me a question in plain English. I will do my best to understand your request and provide a helpful response.

## Importing Workflows

To use the workflow examples:

1.  Open your n8n instance.
2.  Create a new workflow.
3.  Click the "Import from File" option.
4.  Select the desired `.json` file from the project folders.
5.  The workflow will be imported and ready to run.

If you have any issues, feel free to ask me for help.

## Learning Path

I recommend following the learning path outlined in `outline.md`. You can ask me to show you the content of this file.

1.  **Start with Course Materials**: Read the main course content first.
2.  **Follow Sequential Projects**: Work through projects in the suggested order.
3.  **Experiment**: I can help you modify the imported workflows to understand how changes affect behavior.
4.  **Read Documentation**: I can summarize the README files in each project folder for you.

## Project Philosophy

This course emphasizes:
- **Hands-on Learning**: Every concept is demonstrated with working examples.
- **Progressive Complexity**: Starting with simple concepts and building to advanced topics.
- **Practical Application**: Real-world scenarios and use cases.
- **Self-Paced Learning**: Materials designed for independent study.

I am here to support you in this learning process.

## Contributing

If you want to add new projects or materials, I can help you with that. Just tell me what you want to do, and I can help you create the necessary files and folder structure, following the project's conventions.

## File Naming Conventions

- **Workflow files**: Use descriptive names ending in `.json`.
- **Documentation**: Use `README.md` for project explanations.
- **Course content**: Use descriptive names like `outline.md`.

I will adhere to these conventions when creating new files for you.
