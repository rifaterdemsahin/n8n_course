## ‚öñÔ∏è Risk Assessment Framework

1.  **Identify** potential risks in your workflows.
2.  **Assess** the **impact** and **probability** of each risk.
3.  **Prioritize** risks based on their severity.
4.  **Mitigate** risks with appropriate controls.

## ü§ñ The Demo Workflow

`risk-management-demo-workflow.json`

This workflow demonstrates a simple risk assessment process:

1.  **Webhook**: Receives a risk score.
2.  **IF Node**: Checks if the score is high (>= 80).
3.  **High Risk**: If the score is high, it sends a Slack notification for immediate escalation.
4.  **Medium Risk**: If the score is lower, it logs the assessment for standard review.

## ‚úÖ Mitigation Strategies

- **Redundancy**: Have fallback systems in place.
- **Data Validation**: Check data before processing it.
- **Error Handling**: Use `try/catch` blocks and error workflows.
- **Security**: Manage credentials securely and encrypt sensitive data.
- **Change Management**: Have a process for testing and deploying changes.
