# ‚è≥ Handling Rate Limits

Building resilient workflows.

---

## ü§î What are Rate Limits?

APIs use rate limits to control how many requests you can make in a certain amount of time. If you exceed the limit, you'll get an error (usually a `429 Too Many Requests` status code).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Strategies for Handling Rate Limits

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Exponential Backoff

- If a request fails, wait for a short time and then retry.
- Double the waiting time after each failed attempt.

</div>
<div>

### Retry Logic

- Only retry on specific errors (like `429` or `503`).
- Don't retry on errors that won't be fixed by waiting (like `401 Unauthorized`).

## ü§ñ The Demo Workflow

`rate-limit-handling-workflow.json`

This workflow demonstrates how to handle rate limits:

1.  **Set Config**: Defines max retries and delay times.
2.  **Make API Request**: Tries to call an API.
3.  **Check for 429 Error**: If a rate limit error occurs, it enters the retry loop.
4.  **Exponential Backoff**: Calculates how long to wait before the next retry.
5.  **Wait**: Pauses the workflow.
6.  **Loop**: Goes back to the API request until it succeeds or runs out of retries.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Read the API documentation** to understand the rate limits.
- Use **exponential backoff** to avoid overwhelming the API.
- **Check response headers** like `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `Retry-After`.
- Use a **Circuit Breaker** pattern for more advanced scenarios.
