## Practical Examples

### Using an LLM to Interpret an Error Message

*   **Error:** "ERROR: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
*   **AI Explanation:** You are using `.map()` on a variable that is not an array.
*   **Suggestion:** Check the output of the previous node.

### Using AI to Debug a Code Node

*   Copy and paste your code into an AI assistant.
*   The AI can find typos, wrong variable names, or logic errors.
*   It can also provide you with the corrected code.

## Best Practices

*   **Provide Context:** Give the AI the error message, workflow (if possible), and what you have already tried.
*   **Be Specific:** Ask clear questions.
*   **Verify Suggestions:** Always double-check the AI's suggestions before using them.
