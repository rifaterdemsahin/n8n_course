## Understanding Errors

n8n errors can arise from a variety of sources, including:

*   **Configuration issues:** Incorrectly configured nodes, missing credentials, or invalid expressions.
*   **Data-related problems:** Unexpected data formats, empty values, or issues with data mapping.
*   **API errors:** Problems with external services, such as rate limits, authentication failures, or invalid requests.
*   **Custom code errors:** Bugs in JavaScript code within Function or Code nodes.

## When to Use the AI

AI can be a powerful assistant for debugging n8n workflows, especially when:

*   You're new to n8n and unfamiliar with common error patterns.
*   The error message is cryptic or doesn't immediately point to the root cause.
*   You've already tried the basic troubleshooting steps without success.
*   You're looking for a faster way to identify and resolve issues.

## Record in Semblance Folder

As per our project's convention, please document any new findings or solutions related to error handling in the `6_Semblance` folder.

## Different AI Approaches

You can use AI to solve n8n errors in several ways:

*   **Automated Error Log Analysis:** AI models can parse and analyze n8n error logs to identify patterns and suggest potential causes.
*   **Intelligent Documentation Search:** AI-powered search can quickly find relevant information in the n8n documentation, forums, and community discussions.
*   **Workflow Validation:** AI can analyze your workflow's JSON definition to identify potential configuration issues or logical inconsistencies.
*   **Code Debugging:** For errors in custom JavaScript code, AI can help identify syntax errors, logical flaws, and suggest corrections.
*   **Interactive Troubleshooting:** AI-powered chatbots can guide you through the troubleshooting process with a series of targeted questions.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Using an LLM to Interpret an Error Message

If you encounter an error message like "ERROR: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined", you can paste it into a large language model (LLM) like Gemini and ask for an explanation. The LLM can explain that this error typically occurs when you're trying to use the `.map()` function on a variable that is `undefined`, and it can suggest checking the output of the preceding node to ensure it's providing the expected array.

### Example 2: Using AI to Debug a Code Node

If you have a Code node with custom JavaScript that's causing an error, you can copy and paste the code into an AI code assistant and ask it to find the bug. The AI can often spot issues like typos, incorrect variable references, or logical errors and provide a corrected code snippet.

## Best Practices

*   **Provide Context:** When asking an AI for help, provide as much context as possible, including the error message, the workflow JSON (if possible), and the steps you've already taken.
*   **Be Specific:** Ask clear and specific questions. Instead of "My workflow is broken," try "I'm getting a 401 error in my HTTP Request node when trying to connect to the Google Sheets API."
*   **Verify Suggestions:** Always review and understand the suggestions provided by the AI before implementing them in your workflow.

## Common Use Cases

*   **Debugging connection errors:** Resolving authentication and credential-related issues.
*   **Handling data transformation errors:** Fixing problems with data mapping, filtering, and manipulation.
*   **Troubleshooting API-specific errors:** Understanding and resolving errors returned by external services.
*   **Optimizing workflow performance:** Identifying and addressing bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
