# Graphics and Images for the n8n Course

This file contains prompts for generating graphics and images to be used in the n8n course materials, based on the theoretical concepts outlined in the `3_Imaginary` folder.

## 1. Automation Philosophy

*   **File Name**: `automation_philosophy.png`
*   **Prompt**: "A clean, modern illustration showing a series of interconnected gears turning smoothly. One gear is labeled 'Repetitive Tasks', another 'Data Entry', and a third 'Notifications'. A human figure stands next to the gears, looking relaxed and pointing to a lightbulb above their head, symbolizing innovation and creative thinking. The overall style should be minimalist, using a blue and orange color palette."
*   **Rationale**: This image will visually represent the core idea of automation: taking over repetitive tasks to free up human creativity and focus on higher-value work. The gears symbolize the automated processes, and the human figure represents the user benefiting from automation.

## 2. n8n in the Automation Ecosystem

*   **File Name**: `n8n_ecosystem.png`
*   **Prompt**: "A diagram with a central circle labeled 'n8n'. From this central circle, there are connecting lines to other circles labeled 'Zapier', 'Microsoft Power Automate', and 'Custom Scripts'. The 'n8n' circle should be highlighted. Arrows should show data flowing between n8n and other circles representing various applications like 'Google Sheets', 'Slack', 'Discord', and 'GitHub'. The diagram should have a clean, modern look with a blue and orange color scheme."
*   **Rationale**: This diagram will help students understand where n8n fits in the broader landscape of automation tools and how it can act as a central hub for connecting various applications.

## 3. Workflow Design Principles

*   **File Name**: `workflow_design_principles.png`
*   **Prompt**: "A four-panel comic strip illustrating the key principles of workflow design.
    1.  **Panel 1 (Data Flow)**: Shows a clear, easy-to-follow path of data flowing from one node to another, labeled 'Clear Data Flow'.
    2.  **Panel 2 (Error Handling)**: Shows a split path in the workflow. One path has a green checkmark and is labeled 'Success'. The other path has a red 'X' and leads to a node labeled 'Error Notification', illustrating a graceful failure.
    3.  **Panel 3 (Scalability)**: Shows a single workflow that is then duplicated into multiple parallel workflows, handling a larger volume of data, labeled 'Scalable Design'.
    4.  **Panel 4 (Security)**: Shows a workflow with a padlock icon on the credentials and a shield icon over the data, labeled 'Secure by Design'.
    The style should be a simple, friendly cartoon style with a blue and orange color palette."
*   **Rationale**: This visual will break down the abstract principles of workflow design into four easy-to-understand concepts, making them more memorable for students.

## 4. Business Process Automation

*   **File Name**: `business_process_automation.png`
*   **Prompt**: "A three-step illustration of business process automation.
    1.  **Step 1 (Process Mapping)**: A flowchart with interconnected boxes representing a manual business process.
    2.  **Step 2 (Bottleneck Identification)**: The same flowchart, but with one of the boxes highlighted in red and a magnifying glass over it, labeled 'Bottleneck'.
    3.  **Step 3 (Automation & ROI)**: A new, more streamlined flowchart representing the automated process. A large green arrow points from the old flowchart to the new one, with a piggy bank icon and a rising graph labeled 'ROI' next to it.
    The style should be clean and professional, using a blue and orange color palette."
*   **Rationale**: This image will visually guide students through the process of identifying automation opportunities in a business context, from mapping the current process to measuring the return on investment of automation.

## 5. Technical Concepts

*   **File Name**: `technical_concepts.png`
*   **Prompt**: "A triptych of illustrations for key technical concepts.
    1.  **API Integration**: Two computer servers with a puzzle piece connection between them, with arrows showing data flowing back and forth.
    2.  **Data Transformation**: A shape (e.g., a square) entering a box labeled 'n8n' and exiting as a different shape (e.g., a circle), representing data being transformed.
    3.  **Event-Driven Architecture**: A lightning bolt icon striking a bell, which then triggers a series of actions represented by a chain of dominoes falling.
    The style should be modern and abstract, using a blue and orange color palette."
*   **Rationale**: This set of icons will provide simple, memorable visual metaphors for complex technical concepts, making them easier for beginners to grasp.

## 6. Learning Philosophy

*   **File Name**: `learning_philosophy.png`
*   **Prompt**: "An illustration of a staircase, with each step representing a different learning concept.
    - The first step is labeled 'Progressive Disclosure' and shows a book with only one chapter visible.
    - The second step is labeled 'Practical Application' and shows a hand building something with blocks.
    - The third step is labeled 'Community-Driven' and shows several people working together on a puzzle.
    - The top of the staircase has a glowing lightbulb, representing 'Mastery'.
    The style should be an inspiring and motivational illustration, using a blue and orange color palette."
*   **Rationale**: This image will visually represent the course's learning philosophy, showing students the path they will take to master n8n and automation.
