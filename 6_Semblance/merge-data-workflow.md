# Workflow Analysis: merge-data-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow fetches customer data and order data from two different API endpoints, merges them based on a `customerId` key, adds some metadata, and then saves the merged data to another API endpoint.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. HTTP Request Nodes (`Get Customer Data`, `Get Order Data`)

*   **Error**: The APIs at `https://api.example.com/customers` and `https://api.example.com/orders` are unavailable or return an error.
    *   **Resolution**: These are placeholder URLs. They need to be replaced with real API endpoints. Add error handling to these nodes. If one of them fails, the Merge node will only receive partial data.
*   **Error**: The APIs return data that does not contain the `customerId` field.
    *   **Resolution**: The merge operation will fail to match records. Ensure the APIs are returning the `customerId` field. You could add a validation step after each HTTP request to check for the presence of the `customerId`.
*   **Error**: Network issues (e.g., timeout).
    *   **Resolution**: Configure the `Timeout` option and add retry logic.

### 2. Merge Node (`Merge Customer and Orders`)

*   **Error**: The `mergeByKey` operation fails because the `customerId` values don't match between the two datasets, or they are in different formats (e.g., string vs. number).
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the `customerId` is consistent across both data sources. If necessary, use a `Set` node to normalize the `customerId` values before the Merge node.
*   **Error**: One of the input branches provides no data.
    *   **Resolution**: The Merge node will output the data from the branch that did provide data. This might be acceptable, but if both data sources are required, you should add an IF node after the merge to check if the merged data contains fields from both sources.

### 3. HTTP Request Node (`Save Merged Data`)

*   **Error**: The API at `https://api.example.com/save-merged-data` is unavailable or returns an error.
    *   **Resolution**: This is a placeholder URL. Replace it with your actual data storage endpoint. Add error handling to this node.
*   **Error**: The merged data is too large to be sent in a single POST request.
    *   **Resolution**: If the merged dataset is very large, you might need to split it into batches before sending it to the `Save Merged Data` API.
