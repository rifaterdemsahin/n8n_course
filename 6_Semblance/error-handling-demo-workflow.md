# Workflow Analysis: error-handling-demo-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow demonstrates error handling for an API call. It's triggered by a webhook, makes an HTTP request, and has a dedicated error handling branch. If the API call is successful, it logs the success. If it fails, it triggers the `HandleAPIError` branch, which prepares an error message and sends a notification to a Slack channel.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Webhook Node (`Error Demo Webhook`)

*   **Error**: The webhook receives a request without the `apiUrl` in the JSON body.
    *   **Resolution**: The `API Call with Error Handling` node will fail because the URL is not defined. Add a validation step after the webhook to ensure `apiUrl` is present and is a valid URL.

### 2. HTTP Request Node (`API Call with Error Handling`)

*   **Error**: The `onError` property is set to `HandleAPIError`, but this is not a valid n8n error handling mechanism. The `onError` property should be configured in the node settings to either "Stop Workflow", "Continue (using fallback output)", or to trigger an error workflow. The current implementation with a named output `HandleAPIError` is not standard.
    *   **Resolution**: The `onError` property should be configured correctly in the node's settings. A better approach is to use the "Continue (using fallback output)" option and then use an IF node to check if an error occurred, or to set up a dedicated error workflow in the workflow settings.
*   **Error**: The node is configured to retry 3 times, but if it ultimately fails, the workflow will stop unless `Continue on Fail` is enabled.
    *   **Resolution**: Enable the "Continue on Fail" option in the node settings to allow the error handling branch to be executed.

### 3. Slack Node (`Send Error Notification`)

*   **Error**: Invalid Slack credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the Slack credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions to post in the `#error-monitoring` channel.
*   **Error**: Channel not found.
    *   **Resolution**: Verify the channel `#error-monitoring` exists and the n8n bot is a member of it.
*   **Error**: The error message is not providing enough context. The `originalData` is referenced but not defined in the `HandleAPIError` node.
    *   **Resolution**: In the `HandleAPIError` node, make sure to pass along the original input data that caused the error.
