# Workflow Analysis: multi-attachment-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow manually triggers, fetches four different files from a GitHub repository, merges them, aggregates them, and sends them as attachments in a single email using Gmail.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. GitHub Nodes (`Get a file`, `Get a file1`, `Get a file2`, `Get a file3`)

*   **Error**: Invalid GitHub credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the GitHub credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions to read from the specified repository.
*   **Error**: Repository or file not found.
    *   **Resolution**: Double-check the `owner`, `repository`, and `filePath` parameters. Make sure the files exist at the specified paths.
*   **Error**: GitHub API rate limiting.
    *   **Resolution**: Implement a "Retry with exponential backoff" strategy using a `Wait` node and a loop.
*   **Error**: Network issues (e.g., timeout).
    *   **Resolution**: Configure the `Timeout` option in the HTTP Request node (if applicable) or add retry logic.

### 2. Merge Node

*   **Error**: One or more of the GitHub nodes fail, and the Merge node doesn't receive data from all its inputs.
    *   **Resolution**: The Merge node will still pass through the data it receives. However, the `Aggregate` node might not get all the expected files. It's important to have error handling on the GitHub nodes to catch failures before they reach the Merge node.

### 3. Aggregate Node

*   **Error**: The `Aggregate` node doesn't receive any binary data.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the `includeBinaries` option is set to `true`. Also, check that the previous nodes are outputting binary data correctly.

### 4. Gmail Node (`Send a message`)

*   **Error**: Invalid Gmail credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the Gmail OAuth2 credentials are correctly configured and authorized.
*   **Error**: Invalid recipient email address.
    *   **Resolution**: Validate the `sendTo` email address.
*   **Error**: Attachment size limit exceeded.
    *   **Resolution**: Check the total size of the attachments. Gmail has a size limit (usually 25MB). If the files are too large, consider compressing them or uploading them to a cloud storage service and sending a link instead.
*   **Error**: Google API errors (e.g., rate limiting).
    *   **Resolution**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
