# Workflow Analysis: switch-routing-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow is triggered by a webhook for a support ticket. It then uses a Switch node to route the ticket to the appropriate Slack channel based on the ticket's priority and category.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Webhook Node (`Support Ticket Webhook`)

*   **Error**: The webhook receives a request with a missing `priority` or `category`.
    *   **Resolution**: The Switch node will not find a matching condition and the workflow will stop (unless a default output is configured). It's better to have a default output on the Switch node that routes to a "General Support" channel or sends an error message.
*   **Error**: The `priority` or `category` values are not one of the expected values (e.g., "critical", "high", "technical", "billing").
    *   **Resolution**: Same as above. A default output on the Switch node is crucial for handling unexpected values.

### 2. Switch Node (`Route by Priority and Category`)

*   **Error**: The node has no default output. If none of the conditions are met, the workflow will stop.
    *   **Resolution**: Add a default output to the Switch node that routes to a "General Support" channel or a channel for un-routed tickets. The current workflow has a "General Support" node, but it's not connected to the Switch node's default output.
*   **Error**: The conditions are case-sensitive. If the incoming `priority` is "Critical" instead of "critical", it won't match.
    *   **Resolution**: The `caseSensitive` option is set to `true`. For more robust routing, you could set it to `false` or use an expression to convert the incoming values to lowercase before the Switch node.

### 3. Slack Nodes (`Critical Support Team`, `High Priority Support`, etc.)

*   **Error**: Invalid Slack credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the Slack credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions to post in all the specified channels.
*   **Error**: One or more of the channels do not exist or the n8n bot is not a member.
    *   **Resolution**: Verify that all the channels (`#critical-support`, `#high-priority-support`, `#technical-support`, `#billing-support`, `#general-support`) exist and that the n8n bot has been invited to them.
*   **Error**: Slack API rate limiting.
    *   **Resolution**: If you expect a high volume of tickets, you might need to implement a rate-limiting strategy, although it's less likely for this kind of workflow.
