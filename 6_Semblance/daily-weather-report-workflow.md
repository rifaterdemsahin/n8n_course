# Workflow Analysis: daily-weather-report-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow runs daily at 8 AM, fetches current weather and a 5-day forecast from the OpenWeatherMap API, formats the data into an email, and sends it to a specified recipient. It also has basic error handling to send an error email if the API call fails.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Cron Node (`Daily 8 AM Trigger`)

*   **Error**: The n8n instance is down at 8 AM.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure your n8n instance is running reliably. Use a monitoring service to get alerts if n8n is down.

### 2. HTTP Request Nodes (`Fetch Weather Data`, `Fetch 5-Day Forecast`)

*   **Error**: Invalid OpenWeatherMap API key.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the `openWeatherMap` credentials are correct and the API key is valid.
*   **Error**: The API is unavailable or returns an error (e.g., 5xx status code).
    *   **Resolution**: The `Check Weather API Success` node only checks for a `200` status code from the first API call. It doesn't handle errors from the `Fetch 5-Day Forecast` call. Add error handling for the second API call as well. Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for both nodes.
*   **Error**: API rate limiting.
    *   **Resolution**: OpenWeatherMap has a rate limit. If you exceed it, the API will return a `429` error. The current error handling is basic. A more robust solution would be to implement a retry strategy with a delay, as demonstrated in the `rate-limit-handling-workflow.json` analysis.

### 3. IF Node (`Check Weather API Success`)

*   **Error**: This node only checks the success of the `Fetch Weather Data` node. If `Fetch 5-Day Forecast` fails, the workflow will still proceed on the success path and likely fail at the `Process Forecast Data` node.
    *   **Resolution**: Add another IF node to check the success of the `Fetch 5-Day Forecast` API call.

### 4. Email Send Node (`Send Weather Email`)

*   **Error**: Invalid SMTP credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the SMTP credentials are correct.
*   **Error**: The recipient email address is invalid.
    *   **Resolution**: The email address is hardcoded in the `Set Configuration` node. Ensure it's a valid email address. In a more dynamic workflow, you would want to validate the email address.

### 5. General Workflow Issues

*   **Error**: The workflow has two separate branches for success and error that both lead to the `Send Weather Email` node. This is not a standard or clean way to handle this. The `Format Email Content` and `Format Error Email` nodes should probably be followed by their own separate `Send Email` nodes, or the `Send Weather Email` node should be configured to handle both cases with conditional logic in its parameters.
    *   **Resolution**: Refactor the workflow to have a clearer separation of the success and error paths. For example, have two separate `Send Email` nodes.
