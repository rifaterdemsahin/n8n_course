# Workflow Analysis: course-completion-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow is triggered by a webhook when a student completes a course. It prepares completion data, sends a congratulations message to Slack, generates a certificate via an HTTP request, sends a completion email with the certificate, and prepares next steps.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Webhook Node (`Course Completion Webhook`)

*   **Error**: The webhook receives a request with a missing or invalid `studentName` or `studentEmail`.
    *   **Resolution**: The `Prepare Completion Data` node has a fallback for `studentName`, but not for `studentEmail`. Add a check to ensure `studentEmail` is present. If not, you could send an error message to a default Slack channel or email address.
*   **Error**: The webhook is triggered with an unexpected payload.
    *   **Resolution**: Add a validation step after the webhook to ensure the incoming data has the expected structure.

### 2. Slack Node (`Send Congratulations Message`)

*   **Error**: Invalid Slack credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the Slack credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions to post in the specified channel.
*   **Error**: Channel not found.
    *   **Resolution**: Verify the `channel` name is correct and the n8n bot is a member of the channel.
*   **Error**: Slack API rate limiting.
    *   **Resolution**: Implement a "Retry with exponential backoff" strategy.

### 3. HTTP Request Node (`Generate Certificate`)

*   **Error**: The certificate generation API at `https://api.example.com/certificates/generate` is unavailable or returns an error.
    *   **Resolution**: This is a placeholder URL. It needs to be replaced with a real certificate generation service. Add error handling to this node. If the certificate generation fails, you could send a different email to the student explaining the situation and that the certificate will be sent later.
*   **Error**: Network issues (e.g., timeout).
    *   **Resolution**: Configure the `Timeout` option and add retry logic.

### 4. Email Send Node (`Send Completion Email`)

*   **Error**: Invalid email credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the email credentials are correct.
*   **Error**: Invalid recipient email address (`studentEmail`).
    *   **Resolution**: As mentioned for the webhook, validate the `studentEmail` at the beginning of the workflow.
*   **Error**: The `Generate Certificate` node fails and does not provide an attachment.
    *   **Resolution**: The email will be sent without an attachment. The email body should be updated to reflect this if the certificate generation fails. Use a conditional in the `Send Completion Email` node to change the body of the email if no attachment is present.
