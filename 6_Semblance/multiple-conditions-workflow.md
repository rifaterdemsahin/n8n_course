# Workflow Analysis: multiple-conditions-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow demonstrates a nested IF node structure to determine which discount to apply to an order. It checks for premium discount eligibility first, and if the customer is not eligible, it then checks for loyalty discount eligibility.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Set Node (`Create Order Data`)

*   **Error**: The initial data is hardcoded. This is fine for a demo, but in a real-world scenario, this data would come from a trigger (e.g., a webhook from an e-commerce platform). If the trigger data is missing fields like `orderValue` or `customerType`, the workflow could fail.
    *   **Resolution**: In a real workflow, add validation after the trigger to ensure all required fields are present.

### 2. IF Nodes (`Check Premium Discount Eligibility`, `Check Loyalty Discount Eligibility`)

*   **Error**: The `orderValue` and `membershipYears` are converted to integers using `parseInt`. If these fields are not valid numbers, `parseInt` will return `NaN`, and the conditions will not evaluate as expected.
    *   **Resolution**: Add a validation step before the IF nodes to ensure that `orderValue` and `membershipYears` are valid numbers.
*   **Error**: The logic only handles two types of discounts. If more discount types are added, the nested IF structure could become complex and hard to manage.
    *   **Resolution**: For more complex scenarios with multiple conditions, consider using a Switch node instead of nested IF nodes.

### 3. Set Nodes (`Apply Premium Discount`, `Apply Loyalty Discount`, `No Discount`)

*   **Error**: The calculations for `discountAmount` and `finalAmount` could result in floating-point inaccuracies, although `Math.round` is used to mitigate this.
    *   **Resolution**: For financial calculations, it's often better to work with integers (e.g., cents) to avoid floating-point issues.

### 4. General Workflow Issues

*   **Error**: The workflow lacks a final step to *do* something with the formatted output. It just ends after the `Format Final Output` node.
    *   **Resolution**: In a real-world scenario, you would add a node to send an email, update a database, or call another API with the final order details.
