# Workflow Analysis: risk-management-demo-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow is triggered by a webhook for risk assessment. It prepares the assessment data, checks the risk level based on a score, and then takes different actions for high and medium risks. High risks are escalated to a Slack channel, while medium risks are logged via an HTTP request.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Webhook Node (`Risk Assessment Webhook`)

*   **Error**: The webhook receives a request with a missing or non-numeric `riskScore`.
    *   **Resolution**: The `Prepare Risk Assessment` node has a fallback for `riskScore` to `0`, which is good. However, it would be better to add a validation step to ensure `riskScore` is a number and within an expected range. If the validation fails, an error message could be sent.
*   **Error**: The webhook is triggered with an unexpected payload.
    *   **Resolution**: Add a validation step after the webhook to ensure the incoming data has the expected structure.

### 2. IF Node (`Check Risk Level`)

*   **Error**: The `riskScore` is not a number, causing the condition to fail or behave unexpectedly.
    *   **Resolution**: The `Prepare Risk Assessment` node uses `parseInt`, which helps, but if the input is not a number, it will result in `NaN`. The IF node might not handle `NaN` gracefully. It's better to validate the data type before the IF node.

### 3. Slack Node (`Escalate High Risk`)

*   **Error**: Invalid Slack credentials.
    *   **Resolution**: Ensure the Slack credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions to post in the `#risk-management` channel.
*   **Error**: Channel not found.
    *   **Resolution**: Verify the channel `#risk-management` exists and the n8n bot is a member of it.
*   **Error**: Slack API rate limiting.
    *   **Resolution**: Implement a "Retry with exponential backoff" strategy.

### 4. HTTP Request Node (`Log Risk Assessment`)

*   **Error**: The logging API at `https://api.example.com/risk-management/log` is unavailable or returns an error.
    *   **Resolution**: This is a placeholder URL. It needs to be replaced with a real logging service. Add error handling to this node. If logging fails, you could have a fallback mechanism, like sending an email or a Slack message to an admin.
*   **Error**: Network issues (e.g., timeout).
    *   **Resolution**: Configure the `Timeout` option and add retry logic.
