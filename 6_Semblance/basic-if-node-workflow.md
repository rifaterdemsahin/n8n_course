# Workflow Analysis: basic-if-node-workflow.json

## Workflow Description

This workflow demonstrates a basic IF node. It starts with a manual trigger, creates some static weather data, and then uses an IF node to check if the temperature is greater than 30°C. Based on the result, it sets a "Hot Weather Alert" or a "Normal Weather" message.

## Potential Errors and Resolutions

### 1. Set Node (`Create Weather Data`)

*   **Error**: The initial data is hardcoded. In a real-world scenario, this data would come from a trigger or an API call. If the incoming data is missing the `temperature` field, the workflow could fail.
    *   **Resolution**: In a real workflow, add validation after the trigger to ensure the `temperature` field is present and is a number.

### 2. IF Node (`Check Temperature > 30°C`)

*   **Error**: The `temperature` is converted to an integer using `parseInt`. If this field is not a valid number, `parseInt` will return `NaN`, and the condition will not evaluate as expected.
    *   **Resolution**: Add a validation step before the IF node to ensure that `temperature` is a valid number.

### 3. General Workflow Issues

*   **Error**: The workflow lacks a final step to *do* something with the formatted output. It just ends after the `Format Output` node.
    *   **Resolution**: In a real-world scenario, you would add a node to send an email, a Slack message, or trigger some other action with the weather alert.
*   **Error**: The workflow doesn't handle other weather conditions. It only checks for temperature.
    *   **Resolution**: For a more complete weather alert system, you could add more conditions to the IF node or use a Switch node to handle different `weatherCondition` values (e.g., "sunny", "rainy", "cloudy").
